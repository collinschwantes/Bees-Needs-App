# Bees-Needs-App
Data visualization application for the Bee's Needs citizen science project

This is a data visualization app for a citizen science project called the [The Bee's Needs](http://beesneeds.colorado.edu/).
Our aim is to connect citizen scientists back to the data they collected through appealing and informative graphics. 

This application consists of four main components:

1. Navegation bar with graphics inputs
2. Phenology summaries as density plots
3. Nest block summaries as bar plots
4. Map with density contour polygons and points showing nesting blocks 

This app was developed in using Shiny in Rstudio. 

It currently lives here: https://cjschwantes.shinyapps.io/Bees-Needs-App

Future iterations of this application may include data tables, more flexibility in subsetting data, and co-kriged interpolated surfaces
